          <h2>About Dr. Hilleman</h2>

          <p>
            Dr. Maurice Hilleman is considered by many to be the father of
            modern vaccines. Over the course of his career, he developed many of
            the vaccines that are routinely recommended for children today. By
            the end of his career, Dr. Hilleman had prevented pandemic flu,
            combined the measles-mumps-rubella vaccines (MMR), developed the
            first vaccine against a type of human cancer, and much more. It is
            likely that Dr. Hilleman’s work has saved more lives worldwide than
            any other scientist in history.

          <h2>Legacy</h2>

          <p>
            Colleagues note that Dr. Hilleman was always more concerned with
            preventing disease than being recognized for his efforts. Many
            people remain unfamiliar with Dr. Hilleman’s name, despite the fact
            that his work has directly impacted their lives. Dr. Hilleman’s work
            is estimated to save about
            <strong>eight million lives every year</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="quote">
            <p>
              "Dr. Hilleman has saved a countless number of lives through his
              innovation, commitment, and compassion: he is a true hero."
